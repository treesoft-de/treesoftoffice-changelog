<h1 id="changelogversion65">Changelog Version 6.5</h1>
<h2 id="7017">7.0.17</h2>
<h3 id="cad">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="symboltextswithnegativetextheight">Symbol texts with negative text height</h4>
<h5 id="dissection">Dissection</h5>
<p>When inscribing symbol texts with a negative text height, the inserted text was inserted into the document with a positive text height. This text was visible when printing the drawing afterwards.</p>
<h5 id="outcome">Outcome</h5>
<p>The text height of the specified text now corresponds to that of the symbol text.</p>
<h4 id="somemissingiconsadded">Some missing icons added</h4>
<p>Some menu commands lacked icons, which have now been added.</p>
<h4 id="keyboardshortcutsadaptedtoenglishtranslation">Keyboard shortcuts adapted to English translation</h4>
<p>The keyboard shortcuts in the menus are now the same in both the English and German versions.</p>
<h2 id="7016">7.0.16</h2>
<h3 id="cad-1">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="screenscalingenabled">Screen scaling enabled</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-1">Dissection</h5>
<p>The trend is towards monitors with ever-higher resolutions and a constant size, with the result that many control elements are displayed only very small. In order to counteract this and still benefit from the higher resolution, Microsoft has introduced screen scaling. This tells a program which factors have to be used to scale the control elements in order to compensate for the high resolutions. Due to the very early development of Treesoft Office, most parts of the program are not prepared to scale the controls and therefore require extensive and lengthy changes. Some parts have already been adapted, such as the CAD or CAD converter, but scaling had to be activated via a configuration file.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-1">Outcome</h5>
<p>From now on the scaling is basically active, so that the program parts which have already been adapted can benefit from the higher resolution.</p>
<h4 id="colorpaletteincompatiblewith65">Color palette incompatible with 6.5</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-2">Dissection</h5>
<p>It could happen that the versions 7.0.0 - 7.0.15 saved color palettes, which are partly incompatible with earlier versions. This made itself noticeable in an incorrect representation (wrong colors).</p>
<h5 id="outcome-2">Outcome</h5>
<p>The color palettes are now saved correctly. If the problem has already occurred, it is sufficient to change the color palette in version 7.0.16 or newer.</p>
<h4 id="rastercolornotupdated">Raster color not updated</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-3">Dissection</h5>
<p>The grid color was not adjusted after changing the color palette or background color. As a result, the grid was difficult or impossible to see.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-3">Outcome</h5>
<p>The color of the grid will now be adjusted.</p>
<h4 id="newgriddisplay">New grid display</h4>
<p>It is now possible to change the grid from the typical punk representation to a line representation; add the entry "GridUsingLines=ON" in the "System. ini" under the group "[Developer]".</p>
<h4 id="rasterdisplayinhighzoomlevels">Raster display in high zoom levels</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-4">Dissection</h5>
<p>The grid is not displayed if the grid dimension is so small that it no longer has any practical use due to problems with the display speed and clarity.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-4">Outcome</h5>
<p>With the height of the zoom level, the threshold of usability shifts and is now dynamically applied, which means that the grid is displayed again in higher zoom levels.</p>
<h4 id="griddimensionisnotrestoredcorrectly">Grid dimension is not restored correctly</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-5">Dissection</h5>
<p>If a sheet size other than A3 or a scale other than 1:1 was selected, the grid dimension was not restored correctly.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-5">Outcome</h5>
<p>The grid dimension is now restored correctly regardless of sheet size and scale.</p>
<h2 id="7012">7.0.12</h2>
<h3 id="cad-2">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="screenoutputinaccuracy">Screen output inaccuracy</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-6">Dissection</h5>
<p>It could happen that objects within symbols were represented by rounding differences to free objects, offset by one pixel.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-6">Outcome</h5>
<p>A performance optimization for the display of symbols, which did not have any measurable effects on the display speed after comprehensive tests, has been removed. Objects in symbols are now displayed in the same way as free objects.</p>
<h2 id="7011">7.0.11</h2>
<h3 id="cad-3">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="selectionofobjectssimplified">Selection of objects simplified</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-7">Dissection</h5>
<p>The selection of objects in functions such as "Tangent drawing" could become difficult if the anchor point of the respective object could not be approached in the set incremental dimension.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-7">Outcome</h5>
<p>Already an approximation to the anchor point, within the adjusted incremental dimension, is now sufficient to select it.</p>
<h4 id="accelerateddisplayofdashedlinesortexts">Accelerated display of dashed lines or texts</h4>
<p>The display speed of drawings with many dashed lines or texts could be accelerated by up to 30%.</p>
<h4 id="changestocolorpaletteswerenotsaved">Changes to color palettes were not saved</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-8">Dissection</h5>
<p>Changes to the color palettes User 1 to User 5 as well as the last used color palette and background color were not completely saved.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-8">Outcome</h5>
<p>The color palettes and all the information they contain, such as the last used color palette, are now correctly saved and restored.</p>
<h4 id="wintcexedoesnotterminateproperly">WinTC.exe does not terminate properly</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-9">Dissection</h5>
<p>In some installs (on Windows 7) of the beta version (7.0.10) distributed on the top days of 2017, the WinTC. exe is not terminated correctly.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-9">Outcome</h5>
<p>The WinTC.exe will now terminate properly.</p>
<h3 id="cadkonverter">CAD Konverter</h3>
<h4 id="functionsrespondonlytoreturnkey">Functions respond only to return key</h4>
<p>Pressing the Enter key will now perform the same function as pressing the Enter key.</p>
<h4 id="maximumusableworkspaceexpandable">Maximum usable workspace expandable</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-10">Dissection</h5>
<p>In the "Open PDF/DWG/DXF to convert to ZNG for GT/ST" wizards, the usable workspace is limited to the extension of the standard frame drawings, unless the original frame is used.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-10">Outcome</h5>
<p>From now on it is possible to adapt the usable working area for your own frame drawings. For more information on customizing the workspace for your own frame drawings, see the documentation "Arbeitshandbuch-CAD-Konverter.pdf".</p>
<h2 id="6528">6.5.28</h2>
<h3 id="erpdokumente">ERP Dokumente</h3>
<h4 id="crashwhenpostingcreditmemos">Crash when posting credit memos</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-11">Dissection</h5>
<p>Posting credit memos causes a crash if no invoice exists.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-11">Outcome</h5>
<p>The error has been fixed and the user is now told to add an invoice. </p>
<h3 id="stammdaten">Stammdaten</h3>
<h4 id="improvedstabilityonsomesystems">Improved stability on some systems</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-12">Dissection</h5>
<p>On some systems and under the influence of time factors, the software crashed when storing materials and services. </p>
<h5 id="outcome-12">Outcome</h5>
<p>The stability of materials and performance has been improved so that this error can no longer occur.</p>
<h2 id="6527">6.5.27</h2>
<h3 id="cad-4">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="umschaltendersprache">Umschalten der Sprache</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-13">Dissection</h5>
<p>In order to change the CAD language, it was previously necessary to manually copy different translation files into the program directory.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-13">Outcome</h5>
<p>The language is now switched automatically according to the language selected in the login dialog.</p>
<h3 id="crmschnittstellesage">CRM Schnittstelle Sage</h3>
<h4 id="errorwithincorrectlyconfiguredinterface">Error with incorrectly configured interface</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-14">Dissection</h5>
<p>Gaps in error handling of the interface to Sage New Classic.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-14">Outcome</h5>
<p>Error handling related to incorrectly installed connections to Sage New Classic has been improved.</p>
<h3 id="volltextsuche">Volltextsuche</h3>
<h4 id="minimumwordlengthignored">Minimum word length ignored</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-15">Dissection</h5>
<p>No addresses with search terms of less than three characters were found in the address list of Treesoft Office, even if the minimum search word length was set to less than three characters in the settings. Similarly, no materials were found in the material master if the search term was less than two characters.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-15">Outcome</h5>
<p>Both the address list search and the material master search now respond to search terms that are at least one character long. Search terms smaller than the minimum search word length are treated as if the entered term was not found.</p>
<h2 id="6525">6.5.25</h2>
<h3 id="cad-5">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="incorrecttextfitforprojectindividualprinting">Incorrect text fit for project/individual printing</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-16">Dissection</h5>
<p>When using the screen scaling of Windows on high DPI monitors, texts were incorrectly fitted during project/individual printing when using the ISO 3098 font.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-16">Outcome</h5>
<p>Adjustment is now correct even when using Windows screen scaling.</p>
<h4 id="nondashedcirclesandarcsforpdfexport">Non-dashed circles and arcs for PDF export</h4>
<p>Circles and arcs can now also be output with dashed lines in intelligent PDF export.</p>
<h3 id="erpdokumente-1">ERP Dokumente</h3>
<h4 id="crashwheneditingmeasurementlistswithoutanassignedroombook">Crash when editing measurement lists without an assigned room book</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-17">Dissection</h5>
<p>If a measurement list was edited without an assigned room book by the user trying to add a position, the program crashed.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-17">Outcome</h5>
<p>Since positions in measurement lists are always assigned to rooms, it is no longer possible to edit measurement lists without an assigned room book.</p>
<h4 id="crasheswhilewritingnewmaterialorwagestoabillofmaterial">Crashes while writing new material or wages to a bill of material</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-18">Dissection</h5>
<p>The' Write new material or payroll to BOM' function was incorrectly activated after opening the invoice, even though the document was selected. If the user executed the function on the document, an error occurred because no materials or wages can be written directly into the document.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-18">Outcome</h5>
<p>It is no longer possible to execute the function' Write new material or wage to this BOM' on a document.</p>
<h3 id="projektverwaltung">Projektverwaltung</h3>
<h4 id="multipleassignmentofprojectnumbers">Multiple assignment of project numbers</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-19">Dissection</h5>
<p>With slower network connections it could happen that project numbers were assigned several times. This does not cause any problems when creating, copying, logging in and reconstructing, but it does cause problems when the projects are opened again.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-19">Outcome</h5>
<p>We have implemented a procedure that prevents a project number from being assigned more than once.</p>
<h3 id="treesoftoffice">Treesoft Office</h3>
<h4 id="imagesinoptionsdialogimagesinoriginalsizedisplayleadstosoftwarecrash">Images in options dialog - Images in original size Display leads to software crash</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-20">Dissection</h5>
<p>After using the "Show images in original size" function in the options dialog, the program crashed when exiting.</p>
<p>The function "Show images in original size" has been removed completely.</p>
<h4 id="crashwhenopeningbasicsimagesintheoptionsdialog">Crash when opening Basics -&gt; Images in the Options dialog</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-21">Dissection</h5>
<p>The software crashed when opening the Basics -&gt; Images window in the Options dialog, 
if faulty images were stored in the database. </p>

<h4 id="definingaddressesforcustomerinformationtemplate">Defining Addresses for Customer Information Template</h4>
<p>When creating customer information for an address, it was previously not possible to copy the customer information from an existing address.
Especially for users of Treesoft Office ERP, manually filling in customer information is a time-consuming task.</p>
<p>Existing addresses with customer information can now be selected as a template with a short description in the options dialog in the branch "Addresses &gt; Template for customer information". When creating customer information for an address, the following settings are applied when selecting a reference address:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currency - Currency</li>
<li>Check box Copy tax codes from customer base</li>
<li>Tax code</li>
<li>Standard color of documents</li>
<li>Group field Payment terms and conditions</li>
<li>Group field Pricing</li>
<li>Group field Dunning system</li>
<li>Group field Overhead rates GKZ</li>
</ul>
<p>We are gradually changing our source code to a uniform standard. For this reason, the "Fill gaps" function is no longer available for customers' number ranges until a uniform procedure for number ranges has been introduced for our software.</p>

<p>The display problem for normal and alternative items has now been solved.</p>
<h4 id="positionprices">position prices</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-43">Dissection</h5>
<p>Before 2008, the procedure for copying outlines, items and item BOMs was adapted. The procedures overlaped for a short period of time. If you now copy parts from affected items, variances in the item price can occur if the calculation is carried out from the viewpoint of the item or from another viewpoint. This overlap is very rare because it occurs only for very special costing settings and existing documents with overlaps in the item BOM. Thanks to the assistance of a customer, the cause could be analysed in detail.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-41">Outcome</h5>
<p>If you transfer groupings or items from documents with overlaps in the item BOM, these variances no longer occur.</p>

<h4 id="umlautsnotindexedcorrectly">Umlauts not indexed correctly</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-44">Dissection</h5>
<p>With version 6.5. XX, the database connection of the full text server was changed to Unicode. Unfortunately, the special handling of text data blocks in the database was not taken into account. As a result, for example, the long texts of the materials were incorrectly indexed and a search query containing the characters €, äÄ, üÜÜÜ, öÖÖ, ß remained unsuccessful.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-42">Outcome</h5>
<p>Text data blocks are now indexed correctly. In any case, we advise you to completely rebuild all full-text search configurations. To do this, please switch to the Options dialog of Treesoft Office[Ctrl]+[Shift].]+[O]. Select the branch "Basics &gt; Full-text search" and in the context menu for the full-text search configurations, select the command "Reset all configurations" and confirm with "Yes".

<h4 id="fulltextsearchdoesnotalwaysfindresults">Full text search does not always find results</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-58">Dissection</h5>
<p>For large catalogs, the query for very general terms sometimes takes a little longer. In order to keep the application usable, a timeout has been set up to abort the search.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-55">Outcome</h5>
<p>Optimization of the search algorithm has drastically reduced the search time for large catalogs. In a test scenario, the search could be reduced from approx. 60 seconds to less than 0.5 seconds. This corresponds to an improvement of approximately 1200%. Additionally, the timeout has been increased.</p>

Until now, it was not possible to set these characters. As a result, it was not possible to search for materials with a hyphen in the name, for example. </p>
<h5 id="outcome-56">Outcome</h5>
<p>It is now possible to set the special characters for the full text search globally via the options dialog (under Full Text Search -&gt; Configure Syntax). In addition to the option to select other characters, the operators can also be completely deactivated.</p>

<p>After the conversion to the new full-text search, the user interfaces for administration were not changed and modernized for reasons of compatibility.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-58">Outcome</h5>
<p>In the options dialog of Treesoft Office, there is now a central administration interface for managing the full-text search. This interface allows you to manage all full-text search configurations regardless of the category. As a result of this conversion, the old *. CFG files become obsolete and can be deleted. Customers who are not yet using the new full-text search can use a migration to adopt their configurations. The new management interface provides a deeper insight into the actions currently performed by the full-text search and has clear performance advantages due to the parallel construction of several configurations.</p>

<h4 id="outputofallvisiblelayersduringprinting">Output of all visible layers during printing</h4>
<p>If layers of different sheets are made visible, e. g. layers 1 and 2 in a schematic, and then the Print command is executed in the File menu, the visible layers are interpreted and output as a single sheet. This corresponds to the behavior of former direct printing.</p>
<h4 id="printandpdfexportofdashedobjectspart2">Print and PDF export of dashed objects (part 2)</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-62">Dissection</h5>
<p>Both for the screen output and the old print, dashes are or have been applied adaptively. This means, for example, that dashed lines always begin and end with the drawn part. This allows a particularly clean display of dashes. The new printing functions and PDF export did not yet have an adaptive output of dashing.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-59">Outcome</h5>
<p>From now on all dashed lines will be output adaptively. The way in which the adaptation is implemented differs from the screen output of Treesoft CAD. While dashed lines for screen output in Treesoft CAD are split into small segments, the new method uses the pattern of dashing to be adjusted individually for each line and output together with the entire line. The advantage of this is that the display in preview, print and exported PDF are identical.</p>
<h4 id="printandpdfexportofdashedobjectspart1">Print and PDF export of dashed objects (part 1)</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-63">Dissection</h5>
<p>The dashing of objects is determined by the object type. The representation of an object type can be influenced by the plin. dat via the options dialog System &gt; Characters of Treesoft CAD. In addition to the pen width and color, plin. dat also stores a factor for influencing the dashing. This factor has not yet been taken into account, with the result that certain dashes have the same pattern when printing or exporting PDFs.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-60">Outcome</h5>
<p>The factor is now correctly transferred to the dashing. Different dashes are now clearly distinguishable from each other.</p>
<h4 id="remainingoldprintingfunctionsreplaced">Remaining old printing functions replaced</h4>

Selecting "Only active drawing" excludes all pages, except for the active drawing, from printing or intelligent PDF export. Selecting "Only active page" excludes all pages from printing or intelligent PDF export, except for the active layer or sheet (incl. frame drawing) of the active drawing.</p>
<h4 id="areacopiesofelectricalinstallationplanswereincorrectlyexportedprinted">area copies of electrical installation plans were incorrectly exported/printed</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-65">Dissection</h5>
<p>Section copies of electrical installation plans were treated like electrical installation plans, so that several section copies were exported/printed as one page.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-62">Outcome</h5>
<p>Area copies are now recognized as such and treated accordingly. In project printing and intelligent PDF export in Treesoft CAD, area copying is not enabled by default and is therefore not exported/printed.</p>
<h4 id="outputofspecialcharactersforprintingandpdfexport">Output of special characters for printing and PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-66">Dissection</h5>
<p>The first versions of Treesoft CAD were developed for Microsoft DOS. At that time, the common character set for Western Europe was CP850 (DOS-Latin-1). However, this character set did not contain the Greek characters Theta, Omega or Delta, which were necessary for electrical engineering. For this reason, these characters have been placed on other characters that are not required. This new Treesoft character set has not been translated correctly to Unicode characters, which means that all Greek characters were displayed or printed incorrectly when using the ISO 3098 font.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-63">Outcome</h5>
<p>From now on, all characters deviating from the character set CP850 will be translated into the corresponding Unicode characters. The display and output with the ISO 3098 font is now done with the correct characters.</p>
<h4 id="listswithoutcataloguereferenceuseonlyglobalfulltextsearchconfigurations">Lists without catalogue reference use only global full-text search configurations</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-67">Dissection</h5>
<p>Lists in Treesoft CAD without reference to a catalog have so far offered all full-text search configurations for selection, even if these configurations were specifically designed for catalogs. This could lead to confusion when using the full-text search.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-64">Outcome</h5>
<p>Lists such as "Set symbol…" or "Wages" now only use full-text search configurations that are not directly assigned to a catalog.</p>
<h4 id="savingthelastselectedfulltextsearchconfiguration">Saving the last selected full-text search configuration</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-68">Dissection</h5>
<p>If there are several full-text search configurations for a category (e. g. material), the desired configuration had to be selected each time the corresponding list was called. </p>
<h5 id="outcome-65">Outcome</h5>
<p>The last selected configuration is now saved per user for each list. </p>
<h4 id="searchingforexclamationmarksinlists">Searching for exclamation marks in lists</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-69">Dissection</h5>
<p>A special feature of the lists in CAD is the search using logical operators. 
For example, the exclamation point character negates the entire expression. 
It was therefore interpreted as a special character. 
This prevented the system from finding texts containing this character.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-66">Outcome</h5>
<p>The syntax of the negation has been slightly modified to allow searching for an exclamation mark. 
Instead of "!Motor" is now "! Motor" to find all records one with the word "Motor".</p>
<h4 id="listforsecondarysymbolassignmentsalwaysempty">List for secondary symbol assignments always empty</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-70">Dissection</h5>
<p>There was a problem with the integration of the full text search in the list of secondary symbol assignments. 
to update the list.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-67">Outcome</h5>
<p>The list now works as usual again.</p>
<h3 id="cadkonverter-6">CAD Konverter</h3>
<h4 id="renamingofbatchexporttobatchprocessing">Renaming of batch export to batch processing</h4>
<p>The batch export function has now been modified in the program according to the manuals and article/material data.</p>
<h4 id="linetypesarenotexported">Line types are not exported</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-71">Dissection</h5>
<p>The line types from a TreeCAD drawing were not transferred to exported DWG/DXF drawings.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-68">Outcome</h5>
<p>The line types are now transferred to the DWG/DXF drawings to be exported, with the exception of the line width.</p>
<h3 id="mobileanbindung">Mobile Anbindung</h3>
<h4 id="fulltextsearchforaddresses">Full-text search for addresses</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-72">Dissection</h5>
<p>Searching for addresses in the iPhone app did not return any results.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-69">Outcome</h5>
<p>The problem has been fixed and the search for addresses in the iPhone app now works as usual again.</p>
<h3 id="volltextsuche-6">Volltextsuche</h3>
<h4 id="errorhandlinginconnectionwithconfigurationxml">Error handling in connection with configuration. xml</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-73">Dissection</h5>
<p>Customers are increasingly experiencing damage to the configuration file of the find server. Unfortunately, it is not possible to determine exactly why the file is broken. It must be somehow related to a server crash.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-70">Outcome</h5>
<p>In any case, we have improved error handling with the configuration file.</p>
<h4 id="catalogindependentstandardconfigurations">Catalog independent standard configurations</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-74">Dissection</h5>
<p>By installing Treesoft Office, standard full-text search configurations are currently generated for each installed catalog. However, some parts of the software can be searched independently of a catalogue. For this reason, general configurations are required for these locations, which can be searched in all catalogues.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-71">Outcome</h5>
<p>If there are no general full-text search configurations per category at the time of the update or installation, they will be created. </p>
<h2 id="6513">6.5.13</h2>
<h3 id="cad-11">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="revisionofprintandintelligentpdfexport">Revision of print and intelligent PDF export</h4>
<p>With the Intelligent PDF export, the basis was created to completely revise the project/individual print in Treesoft CAD. From now on, there is only one unified dialog for all print functions of all wizards and the intelligent PDF export.
Among the new features are among others:</p>
<ul>
<li>Aligning the drawing on paper</li>
<li>Setting a border taking the printer limit into account</li>
<li>Scaled and true-to-scale output</li>
<li>Choice of font to be used</li>
<li>Choice of the colour palette to be used</li>
<li>Colour and monochrome output</li>
<li>Line thickness application </li>
<li>Selection of the drawings/pages and layers to be exported</li>
<li>Adjustment of the output sequence incl. reversal of the sequence</li>
<li>Live preview that always shows the expected result</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="volltextsuche-7">Volltextsuche</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-75">Dissection</h5>
<p>In the lists in CAD there is the possibility to find records depending on the column Data records. Until now, however, it was not possible to search all data independently of a certain column.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-72">Outcome</h5>
<p>In all lists in CAD there is now the possibility to find records via the full text search. This applies to symbols, materials and services as well as addresses and wages.</p>
<h3 id="crm-4">CRM</h3>
<h4 id="searchandreplaceinthecontactpersonlist">Search and replace in the contact person list</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-76">Dissection</h5>
<p>The function "Search and replace" in the contact person list supports the fields "Salutation, department and position". The fields "Title" and "Name affix"are missing.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-73">Outcome</h5>
<p>Other functions have been added to the "Title" and "Name affix" fields. The functionality can be limited or deactivated via the rights management. "Search and Replace" now works reliably with marks set in the addresses and contacts. The default settings in the options dialog are used as a default for replacing.</p>
<h3 id="system">System</h3>
<h4 id="searchfieldinprojectlisthistoryeventstaskstasksetcallowsprerunninginput">Search field in project list/history/events/tasks/tasks/etc. allows pre-running input</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-77">Dissection</h5>
<p>If an entry is made in the search field with an interruption, a filter is already executed according to the previous entry during the interruption. While the filter was running, the search box was deactivated and all entries following the interruption were discarded until the filter was fully applied. This made the handling of the project list/history/dates/tasks/etc. considerably more difficult.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-74">Outcome</h5>
<p>During the execution of a filter, the search field remains activated and allows for a pre-running input. After the filter has been executed, it is executed again if the input has changed.</p>
<h2 id="6512">6.5.12</h2>
<h3 id="cad-12">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="invisibletextsareoutputwithintelligentpdfexport">Invisible texts are output with intelligent PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-78">Dissection</h5>
<p>Previously, texts with a negative text height were also output.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-75">Outcome</h5>
<p>Texts with a negative text height are no longer output in the intelligent PDF export, just like when printing or exporting to DXF/DWG. Furthermore, the output of texts now corresponds to the settings for printing in Treesoft CAD.</p>
<h4 id="referencesinpdfcreatedbyintelligentpdfexportareshifted">References in PDF created by intelligent PDF export are shifted</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-79">Dissection</h5>
<p>It could happen that links were positioned incorrectly in the generated PDF.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-76">Outcome</h5>
<p>All references in a PDF created by intelligent PDF export are now positioned correctly.</p>
<h4 id="outputofintelligentpdfinblackandwhite">Output of intelligent PDF in black and white</h4>
<p>It is now possible to change the color mode to black and white for the output of intelligent PDFs. For more information, refer to the Intelligent PDF Export manual.</p>
<h3 id="crmadressverwaltung">CRM Adressverwaltung</h3>
<h4 id="automaticnumberassignmentforcustomerssuppliersandemployees">Automatic number assignment for customers/suppliers and employees</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-80">Dissection</h5>
<p>In Treesoft Office, numbers are assigned in some places using the number ranges, including a check whether this number has already been assigned. When assigning numbers to customers, suppliers and employees, automatic number assignment sometimes led to an unexpected termination of the program.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-77">Outcome</h5>
<p>The automatic number assignment for customers, suppliers and employees is corrected and works as expected.</p>
<h3 id="notifier-1">Notifier</h3>
<h4 id="automaticassignmentofaddressestoentries">Automatic assignment of addresses to entries</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-81">Dissection</h5>
<p>When using computer telephony via the notifier, in some cases it was not possible to find an address for the telephone number. </p>
<h5 id="outcome-78">Outcome</h5>
<p>Calls are now logged with address as usual. </p>
<h2 id="6511">6.5.11</h2>
<h3 id="computertelefonie-1">Computertelefonie</h3>
<h4 id="determineavailabletelephoneslines">Determine available telephones/lines</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-82">Dissection</h5>
<p>In Treesoft Office the TAPI interface (versions 1.3 - 2.2) offers the possibility to make and receive calls. For some TAPI drivers, Treesoft Office could not read the telephones/lines via the TAPI interface, so that they were not available for use in Treesoft Office.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-79">Outcome</h5>
<p>By adapting the communication with the TAPI interface, all supported telephones/lines are now read out and are therefore also available for use with Treesoft Office.</p>
<h2 id="6510">6.5.10</h2>
<h3 id="cad-13">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="framelabelingnotcorrect">Frame labeling not correct</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-83">Dissection</h5>
<p>Both the project name and the project description were incorrectly inserted into the drawing frame.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-80">Outcome</h5>
<p>The frame caption is now correct.</p>
<h4 id="textswereprintedwithquestionmarksinsteadofapostropheduringpdfexport">Texts were printed with question marks instead of apostrophe during PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-84">Dissection</h5>
<p>Due to a coding problem, apostrophe was displayed as a question mark in PDFs created by intelligent PDF export.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-81">Outcome</h5>
<p>All texts in PDFs created by intelligent PDF export are now encoded in UTF-8. Apostrophe will be displayed as apostrophe again.</p>
<h4 id="outputformatcanbesetforpdfexport">Output format can be set for PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-85">Dissection</h5>
<p>Until now, the output format of the PDF could not be set for intelligent PDF export.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-82">Outcome</h5>
<p>It is now possible to determine the paper size, orientation and border. Please note that a true-to-scale printing of the border of the generated PDF is only possible if the following parameters are adhered to:</p>
<ul>
<li>The paper size of the PDF must be the same as the paper size of the print.</li>
<li>The view may not be adjusted during printing. Use the actual size here.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="enteringinvalidsymbolnameswhencreatingandeditingsymbols">Entering invalid symbol names when creating and editing symbols</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-86">Dissection</h5>
<p>When creating symbols as well as renaming or copying symbols, it was possible to enter invalid characters for the symbol name. </p>
<h5 id="outcome-83">Outcome</h5>
<p>From now on, only the following characters can be entered for symbol names: 0-9 a-z A-Z!#+-.@^_~</p>
<h4 id="skipdrawingfilesforpdfexport">Skip drawing files for PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-87">Dissection</h5>
<p>It could happen that drawing files containing invalid symbol names were skipped during intelligent PDF export.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-84">Outcome</h5>
<p>Drawing files containing invalid symbol names are now also output.</p>
<h4 id="outputofdashedlinesforpdfexport">Output of dashed lines for PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-88">Dissection</h5>
<p>In the case of intelligent PDF export, dashed lines were originally output as solid lines.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-85">Outcome</h5>
<p>With intelligent PDF export, dashed lines are returned as dashed lines.</p>
<h4 id="createprjinfodat">Create PrjInfo.dat</h4>
<p>The Prjinfo. dat file stores the data of a project that is normally stored in the database. This information is used when reconstructing and registering projects to complete the information in the database. When creating the PrjInfo. dat explicitly, the current contents of the project variables were not saved.</p>

<h4 id="resourceswithseveralassignedarticlesforpdfexport">Resources with several assigned articles for PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-89">Dissection</h5>
<p>If several articles were assigned to an item, only the last added article was displayed in the item information.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-86">Outcome</h5>
<p>All item information for all items assigned to the equipment is now displayed written to each other.</p>
<h4 id="outputoftargetwiringforpdfexport">Output of target wiring for PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-90">Dissection</h5>
<p>Previously, circuit diagrams were always exported with target wiring for intelligent PDF export.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-87">Outcome</h5>
<p>Whether circuit diagrams with target wiring are exported now depends on the corresponding setting (Tools &gt; Options &gt; System &gt; Display &gt; Target Wiring) in Treesoft CAD.</p>
<h4 id="applicationcrashesduringpdfexport">Application crashes during PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-91">Dissection</h5>
<p>It could happen that the application crashes during intelligent PDF export if slightly damaged bitmaps are stored in one of the drawings.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-88">Outcome</h5>
<p>By adapting the functions used to load the bitmaps in a drawing, it has been possible to make them much less sensitive.</p>
<h3 id="cadkonverter-7">CAD Konverter</h3>
<h4 id="exportnotpossible">Export not possible</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-92">Dissection</h5>
<p>It may happen that the export to ZNG cannot be completed if the source drawing contains hatchings.</p>

<h4 id="applicationcrashesduringpdfexport-1">Application crashes during PDF export</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-93">Dissection</h5>
<p>Treesoft CAD could crash when exporting PDF-drawings containing many images.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-90">Outcome</h5>
<p>The buffering, which was supposed to ensure that an image is stored only once in a PDF file, did not work reliably. The bug has been fixed, this has the positive effect that generated PDF files with a lot of images take up less hard disk space.</p>
<h4 id="outputofconnectionpointsforpdfexport">Output of connection points for PDF export</h4>

<h4 id="performanceoptimization">performance optimization</h4>
<h5 id="dissection-97">Dissection</h5>
<p>A new full-text search server has been delivered with the Treesoft Office 6.5 version. One of the advantages of full-text search is that it automatically detects changes to the records in a full-text search configuration and updates them automatically. Due to the system used for tracking the changes, the re-importing of catalogs (catalogues update) via the interfaces DATANORM, ELDANORM, ZVEHNORM and plug-ins took many times the time in versions 6.3 and 6.4, depending on the number of full-text search configurations.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-94">Outcome</h5>
<p>By optimizing the change tracking system, we were able to approximate the speed of importing catalogs to that of version 6.3 or 6.4. The biggest advantage of the new system is that after updating an existing catalog to which there is a full-text search configuration, the full-text search does not have to be rebuilt and can be used immediately.</p>

<p>In building services engineering, you can choose between 4 different dimensioning types: Step dimensions, horizontal chain dimensioning, vertical chain dimensioning and single dimensioning. Within the dimensioning function, the closest objects can be trapped up, down, left or right. These functions can be called not only via the toolbar buttons, but also via short keys. With the exception of the single dimension, objects are captured with the Ctrl key and the corresponding arrow key; in the single dimension, the Shift key must be pressed instead of the Ctrl key.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-95">Outcome</h5>
<p>The "Single dimensioning" function in building services corresponds to the "Dimensioning" function of the SCM wizard, i. e. objects are captured with the Shift+arrow key. In order to optimize the workflow, both the shortcut keys with the Shift key and the Ctrl key are now taken into account in building services engineering. </p>

<p>Drawings converted to ZNG format via CAD converter are displayed as background drawings in Treesoft CAD. If the page format or scale is changed in Treesoft CAD, the background drawing must also be adapted. It could happen that the reference point of the background drawing was moved outside the drawing area. Subsequent changes to sheet format or scale were ignored.</p>
<h5 id="outcome-101">Outcome</h5>
<p>The reference point of the background drawing is now placed exactly in the middle of the working area by the CAD converter when converting to ZNG format. Changes to sheet format or scale in Treesoft CAD should no longer have the effect of moving the datum to an area outside the drawing.</p>
