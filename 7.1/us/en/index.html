<h4 id="bookmarksinexportedpdfspart2">Bookmarks in exported PDFs (Part 2)</h4>
<p>The bookmarks for individual drawings in exported PDFs were created from the comments that can be stored for each drawing. It is not possible to store several comments in different languages, so from now on the bookmarks are determined by the drawing type. If the language is set to German, the drawing type is output in German. If the language is neither German nor English, but the alternative language is German, the drawing types are also output in German. In all other cases, the output will be in English.</p>

<h4 id="changestotheuseofthenewvatratesfrom01072020">Changes to the use of the new VAT Rates from 01.07.2020</h4>
<p>Due to the current crisis, the German government has decided to reduce the value added tax from 19% to 16% and from 7% to 5% for the period from 01.07.2020 to 31.12.2020 inclusive.
This update includes all changes so that you can invoice with these changed rates from July onwards. </p>
<p>After you have installed the update, you should configure the new tax codes in the options dialog under Basis &gt; Tax Rates as follows</p>
<pre><code>| SC | Designation   | Set | Valid from | Old SC |
| -- | --------------| --- | ---------- | ------ |
|  4 | Full tax rate | 16% | 01.07.2020 |      1 |
|  5 | Half tax rate |  5% | 01.07.2020 |      2 |
|  6 | Full tax rate | 19% | 01.01.2021 |      4 |
|  7 | Half tax rate |  7% | 01.01.2021 |      5 |
</code></pre>
<p>You can then select control codes 6 and 7 accordingly in the assignment matrix.
The correct tax rates are then used to calculate the VAT, depending on the document date. </p>
<p>Technical Details:</p>
<p>Previously, the VAT rate was saved directly in each item for a document. Due to the structure of the ERP, each item basically exists only once. It does not matter whether the item is transferred from a quotation to an order confirmation and then to an invoice, for example. Thus it would not have been possible to create a partial invoice before the increase with 19% and after the increase with 16%. Due to the change made now, an item now only contains the tax class (full tax rate, half tax rate, …). Based on this tax class in combination with the tax code of the document (taxable, tax-exempt, …) and the document date, the correct value added tax is now determined dynamically via the allocation matrix.</p>
<p>To make this change possible, the item data must be partially converted. In most cases, this conversion is done automatically and no user intervention is required. Should we still find a tax code within an item that we cannot automatically convert to a tax class, the user must make this assignment manually when opening any document for the first time.</p>

<p>If a project was assigned the wrong native language and a drawing was opened and saved, all texts of the saved drawing now have the wrong assigned mother language. The adjustment of the project mother language does not change the mother language of the respective texts. This can now be adapted in the "Text" dialog by left mouse clicks on the country flag on the left above the text input or via the context menu in the "Translate" dialog. If a text already has a translation for the new mother language, the languages of the affected translation and the text are swapped. </p>

<p>When copying electrical components, the marking was also copied, i.e. after the copying process, two electrical components with the same marking existed in the floor plan. 
In order to avoid this, a '$' character is now inserted into the marking instead of the circuit and the code number. This is to signal to the user that he wants to use the component 
I'll have to rewrite it.</p>
<h4 id="positionlist">Position list</h4>
<p>When working with areas in a floor plan, the area was displayed together with the number of the floor plan in the column "Floor plan" in the converted position list.
The error did not occur in the cumulated position list.</p>
<h4 id="circuitsconnections">Circuits/Connections</h4>
<p>When calling the functions, the respective list is now automatically generated for all areas and does not have to be created explicitly; the "Start" button has been removed from the toolbar. 
The display of individual circuits has also been improved by highlighting the selected circuit in color and displaying the rest of the drawing in gray tones. If segments of a
circuit is distributed over different floor plans, these are displayed in a different object type. This object type can be selected in the options dialog under Floor plan-&gt;Object types in the drop-down list field "Line display".</p>

<h4 id="filterexecutionoptimized">Filter execution optimized</h4>
<p>Address filters can be used to search for specific addresses. Depending on the application, very complex filters can be created, which take several minutes to execute. 
Previously, the application was completely blocked during this time. With the new address list, this no longer happens and the filter is executed in the background. 
Unfortunately, it was not always clear to the user that the filter was still running. To make this clear, the following measures have been taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>The filter name is now displayed directly in the title of the address list and not after the execution.</li>
<li>During execution, most buttons of the address list are disabled.</li>
<li>Whenever the address list loads something, a loading indicator is displayed in the toolbar on the far right.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filterresultsforcontactpersonsandcommunication">Filter results for contact persons and communication</h4>
<p>As a result, an address filter can not only filter addresses, but also the contact persons and communication in these addresses.

<p>This allows you to change the output language on the screen, print and export PDF files in real time.
There is no need to make copies for translated drawings; one drawing contains all translations.</p>
<p>This change requires changing the ZNG file format and assigning a mother language to each project.
For more information, see the Foreign Language Translation Guide.</p>

<h4 id="updatedworkplaceinstallations">Updated workplace installations</h4>
<p>In this upgrade, there are changes to the installations for individual workstations (<code>WorkstationSetup.exe</code>). 
If you have a server license, it is necessary to update all workstations. 
Run <code>WorkstationSetup.exe</code> from the program directory of Treesoft Office on the respective workstations. 
The program directory of your server can be accessed via the <code>TreesoftProgram</code> share. </p>
<p>z.B.: <code>\\&lt;server-name&gt;\TreesoftProgram\WorkstationSetup.exe</code></p>
<h4 id="newandrenamedservices">New and renamed services</h4>
<p>In the course of this upgrade, some changes were made in connection with services. </p>
<p>The following names have changed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treesoft Find Server -&gt; Treesoft Fulltext Search (TreesoftFindServer -&gt; TreesoftFulltextSearch)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following services have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Treesoft Fulltext Search Demo (TreesoftFulltextSearchDemo)</li>
<li>Treesoft Backend Demo (TreesoftBackendDemo)</li>
</ul>
<p>The latter two services are specifically responsible for the demo client and are only used there.
Previously, this task was performed by a single service, which has now been split for speed reasons, among other reasons. </p>
<p>These changes may affect your backup concept. 
If you are using a batch-based script for the backup, please correct the names of the services accordingly.</p>
<h4 id="flamerobinreplacestheiboconsole">Flamerobin replaces the IBOConsole</h4>
<p>So far we have delivered the program IBOConsole for the separate access to the database.

In the program directory of Treesoft Office there is a link to start Flamerobin with preconfigured databases.</p>

<p>It is now possible to update floor plan drawings exported using the bidirectional module.

The command "Update floor plan drawing" is then available in the toolbar and in the "Export" menu. After starting the function, select the new floor plan file. The export areas are automatically transferred to the new floor plan drawing. In the export dialog, the transferred export areas are displayed with the status "Update". Start the export by clicking the "OK" button. Before the export, a backup of the active project is automatically created, which you can restore in case of a problem in CAD via the menu "Project &gt; Manage &gt; Reconstruct …".</p>
