<h1 id="changelogversion71">Changelog Version 7.1</h1>
<h2 id="7123releasedate11292019releasedate">7.1.23 <releasedate>11/29/2019</releasedate></h2>
<h3 id="crmadressverwaltung">CRM Adressverwaltung</h3>
<h4 id="addresslistlosesmarkerswhenmultiplemarkersareenabled">Address list loses markers when multiple markers are enabled</h4>
<p>The multiple marker could easily be lost by accidental clicking in the table. 
Now it behaves as expected, so the check box must be checked or unchecked directly. 
A click on the row is no longer sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="cad">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="projectrelatedtextmodulefile">Project-related text module file</h4>
<p>The functions for creating and editing project-related text module files have been removed.</p>
<h3 id="cadgebudetechnikassistent">CAD Gebäudetechnik-Assistent</h3>
<h4 id="copyingelectricalcomponents">Copying electrical components</h4>
<p>When copying electrical components, the marking was also copied, i.e. after the copying process, two electrical components with the same marking existed in the floor plan. 
In order to avoid this, a '$' character is now inserted into the marking instead of the circuit and the code number. This is to signal to the user that he wants to use the component 
I'll have to rewrite it.</p>
<h4 id="positionlist">Position list</h4>
<p>When working with areas in a floor plan, the area was displayed together with the number of the floor plan in the column "Floor plan" in the converted position list.
The error did not occur in the cumulated position list.</p>
<h4 id="circuitsconnections">Circuits/Connections</h4>
<p>When calling the functions, the respective list is now automatically generated for all areas and does not have to be created explicitly; the "Start" button has been removed from the toolbar. 
The display of individual circuits has also been improved by highlighting the selected circuit in color and displaying the rest of the drawing in gray tones. If segments of a
circuit is distributed over different floor plans, these are displayed in a different object type. This object type can be selected in the options dialog under Floor plan-&gt;Object types in the drop-down list field "Line display".</p>
<p>In addition, the list remains open while individual circuits are displayed, so that you can navigate through the list without having to restart the display function each time.</p>
<h4 id="cablelineconnections">Cable/line connections</h4>
<p>The list "Cable connections" is sorted by the column "Circuit" by default. This column was previously sorted numerically, so that alphanumeric circuits can be mixed

<p>A highlight of this new upgrade is the revised duplicate cleanup. 
All CRM customers can now retrieve 
Only the duplicate resolution requires an additional license. 
If such a license is not yet available, the help opens with a detailed description and why you should definitely use this module.</p>

<h4 id="filterexecutionoptimized">Filter execution optimized</h4>
<p>Address filters can be used to search for specific addresses. Depending on the application, very complex filters can be created, which take several minutes to execute. 
Previously, the application was completely blocked during this time. With the new address list, this no longer happens and the filter is executed in the background. 
Unfortunately, it was not always clear to the user that the filter was still running. To make this clear, the following measures have been taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>The filter name is now displayed directly in the title of the address list and not after the execution.</li>
<li>During execution, most buttons of the address list are disabled.</li>
<li>Whenever the address list loads something, a loading indicator is displayed in the toolbar on the far right.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filterresultsforcontactpersonsandcommunication">Filter results for contact persons and communication</h4>
<p>As a result, an address filter can not only filter addresses, but also the contact persons and communication in these addresses.
Depending on the setting, only filtered contact persons and communications are displayed in a filtered address, or all of them are displayed, but the filtered ones are marked with a color.
This mechanism did not work properly in all situations.</p>
<h4 id="multipleshippingconsideredtoomanycontacts">Multiple shipping considered too many contacts</h4>
<p>In the case of multiple sending, depending on the address filter, it could happen that too many contact persons were taken into account.</p>

<h4 id="searchinworkstationsnowcaseinsensitive">Search in workstations now Case-Insensitive</h4>
<p>The new list of work centers now makes it possible to search specifically for work centers. Up to now, this search was case-sensitive. 
However, since you rarely know the exact spelling of a work center, the search now ignores upper and lower case.</p>

<h4 id="synchronizationofsalutationandlettersalutationwiththesagenewclassicinterface">Synchronization of salutation and letter salutation with the Sage New Classic interface</h4>
<p>The salutation/letter salutation is now also taken into account in the comparison. In Sage New Classic - in contrast to Treesoft CRM - the salutation (is rather the salutation by letter) is not stored as text, but coded. We encode/decode the information during the comparison into the corresponding valid formats.</p>

The same applies to Datanorm price files that can be used to update prices via price maintenance.
If the Datanorm file did not contain net prices, but the price file did, then it was not possible to select net prices in the price calculation.
The prices were imported correctly, but were not available for price calculation. 
This error has now been corrected.</p>

<h4 id="contrastbetweenbackgroundandtextcolorofcalendarentriesimproved">Contrast between background and text color of calendar entries improved</h4>

<h4 id="f2functionnewlyimplementedandswitchedtodockablewindows">F2 function newly implemented and switched to dockable windows</h4>
<p>The F2 function was implemented from scratch and switched to undockable windows.
The articles/symbols to be displayed are now loaded much faster. The window handling
was significantly improved. A list of the advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster loading of tables</li>
<li>Better window handling with single or multi-screen operation</li>
<li>Windows can now be docked or undocked, the program remembers the positions and sizes of the windows.</li>
<li>Now all main windows of the function can be opened at the same time (Article/Name/Graphic)</li>
<li>Instead of only articles/symbols of the selected catalog branch, all articles/symbols of sub-branches can now also be displayed.</li>

<p>This allows you to change the output language on the screen, print and export PDF files in real time.
There is no need to make copies for translated drawings; one drawing contains all translations.</p>
<p>This change requires changing the ZNG file format and assigning a mother language to each project.

<p>In this upgrade, there are changes to the installations for individual workstations (<code>WorkstationSetup.exe</code>). 
If you have a server license, it is necessary to update all workstations. 
Run <code>WorkstationSetup.exe</code> from the program directory of Treesoft Office on the respective workstations. 
The program directory of your server can be accessed via the <code>TreesoftProgram</code> share. </p>
<p>z.B.: <code>\\&lt;server-name&gt;\TreesoftProgram\WorkstationSetup.exe</code></p>
<h4 id="newandrenamedservices">New and renamed services</h4>
<p>In the course of this upgrade, some changes were made in connection with services. </p>

Previously, this task was performed by a single service, which has now been split for speed reasons, among other reasons. </p>
<p>These changes may affect your backup concept. 
If you are using a batch-based script for the backup, please correct the names of the services accordingly.</p>
<h4 id="flamerobinreplacestheiboconsole">Flamerobin replaces the IBOConsole</h4>

The command "Update floor plan drawing" is then available in the toolbar and in the "Export" menu. After starting the function, select the new floor plan file. The export areas are automatically transferred to the new floor plan drawing. In the export dialog, the transferred export areas are displayed with the status "Update".
