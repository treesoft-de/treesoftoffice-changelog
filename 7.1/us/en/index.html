<h3 id="crmadressverwaltung">CRM Adressverwaltung</h3>
<h4 id="addresslistlosesmarkerswhenmultiplemarkersareenabled">Address list loses markers when multiple markers are enabled</h4>
<p>The multiple marker could easily be lost by accidental clicking in the table. 
Now it behaves as expected, so the check box must be checked or unchecked directly. 
A click on the row is no longer sufficient.</p>
<h3 id="cadkonverter">CAD Konverter</h3>
<h4 id="projectlockdown">Project lockdown</h4>
<p>The CAD converter now checks unilaterally whether the project to be processed has been locked.</p>
<h3 id="cad">CAD</h3>
<h4 id="foreignlanguagetranslationextendedbyadditionallanguages">Foreign language translation extended by additional languages</h4>
<p>The range of languages output with the character set "ISO 3098" has been extended. See https://github.com/hikikomori82/osifont</p>
<h4 id="foreignlanguagetranslationextendedbyadditionallanguagescharactersets">Foreign language translation extended by additional languages/character sets</h4>
<p>Additional character sets have been added to support Chinese/Japanese/Korean.
Unfortunately, these cannot be used correctly via the PDF export at this time. Please contact our support if you want to export them via intelligent PDF export.</p>
<h4 id="foreignlanguagetranslationextendedbymultipleselectionindictionary">Foreign language translation extended by multiple selection in dictionary</h4>
<p>Several entries can now be marked for deletion in the dictionary.</p>
<h4 id="statusoffontsinforeignlanguagetranslation">Status of fonts in foreign language translation</h4>
<p>Fonts which cannot be loaded are now displayed in red in the list of fonts.</p>
<h4 id="projectrelatedtextmodulefile">Project-related text module file</h4>
<p>The functions for creating and editing project-related text module files have been removed.</p>
<h4 id="nativelanguageofdictionarycanonlybechangedviakeycombination">Native language of dictionary can only be changed via key combination</h4>
<p>The native language of the dictionary is defined by the order of the languages. The first entry is always the native language. Since this entry has a special meaning, it can only be changed using the key combination CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+M.</p>

<h3 id="cadgebudetechnikassistent">CAD Gebäudetechnik-Assistent</h3>
<h4 id="copyingelectricalcomponents">Copying electrical components</h4>
<p>When copying electrical components, the marking was also copied, i.e. after the copying process, two electrical components with the same marking existed in the floor plan. 
In order to avoid this, a '$' character is now inserted into the marking instead of the circuit and the code number. This is to signal to the user that he wants to use the component 
I'll have to rewrite it.</p>
<h4 id="positionlist">Position list</h4>
<p>When working with areas in a floor plan, the area was displayed together with the number of the floor plan in the column "Floor plan" in the converted position list.
The error did not occur in the cumulated position list.</p>
<h4 id="circuitsconnections">Circuits/Connections</h4>
<p>When calling the functions, the respective list is now automatically generated for all areas and does not have to be created explicitly; the "Start" button has been removed from the toolbar. 
The display of individual circuits has also been improved by highlighting the selected circuit in color and displaying the rest of the drawing in gray tones. If segments of a
circuit is distributed over different floor plans, these are displayed in a different object type. This object type can be selected in the options dialog under Floor plan-&gt;Object types in the drop-down list field "Line display".</p>
<p>In addition, the list remains open while individual circuits are displayed, so that you can navigate through the list without having to restart the display function each time.</p>
<h4 id="cablelineconnections">Cable/line connections</h4>
<p>The list "Cable connections" is sorted by the column "Circuit" by default. This column was previously sorted numerically, so that alphanumeric circuits can be mixed 
up into were included in the list. Now an alphanumeric sorting is applied.</p>

<h4 id="problemssavingdrawingswithtpiecesfixed">Problems saving drawings with T-pieces fixed</h4>
<p>When saving drawings in the new data format, it could happen that several symbol definitions were generated for similar T-connectors. When reading such a drawing the processing could crash.</p>
<h4 id="autocompletionoptimized">Autocompletion optimized</h4>
<p>The autocomplete results in the Text dialog are now sorted.</p>
<h4 id="notificationofuntranslatedtextduringexportandprinting">Notification of untranslated text during export and printing</h4>

<h3 id="crm">CRM</h3>
<h4 id="filterexecutionoptimized">Filter execution optimized</h4>
<p>Address filters can be used to search for specific addresses. Depending on the application, very complex filters can be created, which take several minutes to execute. 
Previously, the application was completely blocked during this time. With the new address list, this no longer happens and the filter is executed in the background. 
Unfortunately, it was not always clear to the user that the filter was still running. To make this clear, the following measures have been taken:</p>
<ul>
<li>The filter name is now displayed directly in the title of the address list and not after the execution.</li>
<li>During execution, most buttons of the address list are disabled.</li>
<li>Whenever the address list loads something, a loading indicator is displayed in the toolbar on the far right.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="filterresultsforcontactpersonsandcommunication">Filter results for contact persons and communication</h4>
<p>As a result, an address filter can not only filter addresses, but also the contact persons and communication in these addresses.
Depending on the setting, only filtered contact persons and communications are displayed in a filtered address, or all of them are displayed, but the filtered ones are marked with a color.
This mechanism did not work properly in all situations.</p>
<h4 id="multipleshippingconsideredtoomanycontacts">Multiple shipping considered too many contacts</h4>
<p>In the case of multiple sending, depending on the address filter, it could happen that too many contact persons were taken into account.</p>

<h4 id="searchinworkstationsnowcaseinsensitive">Search in workstations now Case-Insensitive</h4>
<p>The new list of work centers now makes it possible to search specifically for work centers. Up to now, this search was case-sensitive. 
However, since you rarely know the exact spelling of a work center, the search now ignores upper and lower case.</p>
<h3 id="crmerpschnittstelle">CRM ERP-Schnittstelle</h3>
<h4 id="synchronizationofsalutationandlettersalutationwiththesagenewclassicinterface">Synchronization of salutation and letter salutation with the Sage New Classic interface</h4>
<p>The salutation/letter salutation is now also taken into account in the comparison. In Sage New Classic - in contrast to Treesoft CRM - the salutation (is rather the salutation by letter) is not stored as text, but coded. We encode/decode the information during the comparison into the corresponding valid formats.</p>
<h3 id="erppreisberechnung">ERP Preisberechnung</h3>
<h4 id="selectionofnetpricesafterimportingadatanormpricefilenotpossible">Selection of net prices after importing a Datanorm price file not possible</h4>
<p>Datanorm files can contain both net and gross prices. 
The same applies to Datanorm price files that can be used to update prices via price maintenance.
If the Datanorm file did not contain net prices, but the price file did, then it was not possible to select net prices in the price calculation.
The prices were imported correctly, but were not available for price calculation. 
This error has now been corrected.</p>
